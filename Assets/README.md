These classes allow easy access to the JobTech APIs and Platsbanken through Unity. A demo scene is provided, allowing users to quickly build up Unity projects making use of jobtechdev.se API:s and data about the Swedish labour market. 

Instructions

To access jobtechdev.se API:s you will need your own private API-key. The API-key can be easily be requested at:
https://apirequest.jobtechdev.se/

This API key must be added in the inspector to the Platsbanken component in the Scene "PlatsbankenDemo". No third-party components are used so setup should be hassle-free.

For best visuals, set the game window to Fixed Resolution at 1028 x 768 pixels.
